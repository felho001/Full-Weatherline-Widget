# Instructions:

 1. Put your API code from openweathermap.org at Line 19.
 2. Set locale language code at Line 22 (Please pay attention if you set this, the language of "city name" will be in your native language after step 3)
 3. Turn on your "Location Services" for reading the name of city and for once and forever, you can turn it off after loading.
 4. Screen Size:

if you are on large screen dievices such as Pro Max, XS Max, even XR, set the widget size according to:

Line 342: widget.padding = 0

if you are on old and small devices (like me :D ), don't need to change anything.

 5. Widget has dynamic background for morning, afternoon and night and for setting this mode, you should do this:

Line 30: const imageBackground = false

And for using your gallery photos as a transparent type, do as:

Line 31: const imageBackground = true
Line 34: const forceImageUpdate = true

and after your selected proper photo: 

Line 34: const forceImageUpdate = false

 6. Weather unit:

Line 285: units: "Metric"
          units: "Fahrenheit"
          units: "Imperial"
          
          
 7. Line 40: HoursToShow : number > Number of predicted hours to show, Eg: 3 = a total of 4 hours in the widget (Default: 3 for the small and 11 for the medium one but to be shown in the Large size only).
 
const hoursToShow = 9

const daysToShow = 6   

 8. Line 50: 12 Hours : 12 or 24?
    and                diagram12Hours = ?!
